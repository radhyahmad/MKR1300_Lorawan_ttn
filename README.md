# MKR1300_Lorawan_ttn
arduino mkr1300 

This project is aimed to use IoT lorawan standard protocol to connect to The Things Network (TTN), with an Arduino MKR1300 (Lora Node) to collect data from DHT22 (temperature and humidity). It has been made by programming with Arduino IDE, MKRWAN library to connect to the TTN. We could send the data to TTN cloud in real-time, which is able to visualize raw data of sensors.
A lorawan network sensor system consists of MCU (Arduino MKR1300) Dev Kit as data acquisition that collects and processes raw data of sensors, and an integrated DHT22 which is an environment sensor.
